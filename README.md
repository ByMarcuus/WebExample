This is a webpage I created sometime ago.
Now I'm remaking it, so I can see the progression I had during the last ~4 years.

NOTE: You will need to run an HTTP server in order to show this.
If you don't, for example, buttons like 'subpages' won't properly show up.
If run an HTTP server is complicated for you, you can always install VS Code, install the extension Live Server and run it.
